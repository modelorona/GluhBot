# GluhBot

A for-fun Discord bot made in my spare time to play random audio files.

It downloads them from a Google drive folder that I own. If you want to implement your own, you need to find the ID of your folder as well as get credentials, and then place them in the .env file.

The commands can be seen in audio_cog.py, in the options function.
